### Technical PM Edition (Lighter Version)

## Challenge

We're transporting you back to the early 2000's â€“ we're building a quick blog. We're asking you to build an application with two pages:

- Blog posts, to display a list blog posts and a short excerpt, and
- Post detail, to display a full blog post.

The backend for this blog are Github Gists. The idea is that you can enter  a username to look up on Github and the index page (blog posts) will display excerpts of all the user saved Gists. The post detail page will then display the full content of the gist.

Blog posts page must be searchable, and Post details page must be able to show its formatted Markdown as HTML in the case Gists content was saved with `.md` extension.


## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- React
- VS Code

## Further Exploration
- Tailwind CSS
- Desktop View
- Project Completion

## Questions

- What are your thoughts around continuous integration, where & how you would deploy this application?

*Continuous integration is important for real word applications because UX trends change, coding languages and APIs become deprecated, and clients ask for newer features.*

- What do you think you would do differently if you had 2 weeks to complete this assignment and no requirement to use Github. What would your backend solution look like?

*I would have finished the tutorial I was following and continued to build out the required features.*

- How and where do you feel like this application should be deployed to?

*Nowhere!*

- Are you happy with your own solutions? If yes, which parts do you think are really well done, if not, what would you want to change?

*Yes and No. There is not enough time for someone of my skill level to finish a project like this in 45-60 minutes and I definitely spent too much time on it but enjoyed learning about React, using Git, and playing around on the front-end.*

## Delivery

Feel free to deliver this as your standard NPM/Yarn type of installation. Docker is fine as well. We expect delivery as a Zip file or from a public Git repository. (You can fork this repository as a starting point)

## Thanks

We really want to thank you for taking the time to run through this code challenge. We value your time immensely. If you have any suggestions as to how we could improve this exercise, please let us know.

Again, thanks! And happy coding :)
